# SAVIEN-Project
This project is a webpage that 4 other friends and I have created. We created some dynamic webpages into the website and a geographic map that take real time data and showcases it into the map. The project purpose was to see how polluted Vietnam air was in different city and to resolve the issue.  We are creating other functions to the website to improve upon it.
